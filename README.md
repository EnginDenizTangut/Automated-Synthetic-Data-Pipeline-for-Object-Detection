# Automated-Synthetic-Data-Pipeline-for-Object-Detection
A Python-based automation system developed to overcome the ‘data labeling’ bottleneck in computer vision projects, producing labels with 100% accuracy (ground-truth). The training and validation of the YOLOv8 model was performed using synthetic data generated with Domain Randomization techniques.
